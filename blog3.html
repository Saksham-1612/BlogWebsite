          <h2>8 Genius Tips for Waking Up Early</h2>
          <p>
            Early morning wake-ups can be difficult, as the thought of sleeping
            in is usually a much more appealing option. However, waking up early
            boasts positive health benefits, including better concentration,
            improved quality of sleep, long-lasting energy, productivity and
            more
          </p>
          <p>
            Waking up early takes commitment, but it's possible to turn even the
            latest riser into an early bird.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Here are some simple tips to help you get in the habit of waking up
            early:
          </h4>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>Set an earlier bedtime</li>
            <p>
              Training your body to fall asleep earlier may help you rise
              earlier each morning. Most adults should aim to get between seven
              and nine hours of sleep each night - anything less than that can
              cause you to struggle with waking up early.
            </p>
            <li>Unplug before bed</li>
            <p>
              “Unplugging” from smartphones and laptops about 30 minutes before
              bed can contribute to a better night of sleep. According to The
              Sleep Judge, the blue light emitted from screens can alter your
              body's natural melatonin levels, making it more difficult to fall
              asleep. An earlier bedtime with zero interference from tech can
              leave you feeling happier and more energized the next day.
            </p>
            <li>Avoid late-night snacking</li>
            <p>
              While some studies have shown that snacking close to bedtime can
              help dull any hunger pains that may appear overnight, others have
              shown that it can cause less enjoyable symptoms such as acid
              reflux. It's easy to confuse hunger with tiredness, so instead,
              ditch the snacks and save your appetite for breakfast.
            </p>
            <li>Avoid sugary energy drinks and coffee</li>
            <p>
              Energy drinks and coffee may give you the extra boost you need to
              study, but ingesting large amounts of sugar or caffeine before bed
              can make it more challenging to fall asleep and stay asleep.
              Limiting consumption of sugary sodas, energy drinks and coffee has
              been proven to produce healthier sleeping habits. Try switching to
              water or tea before bed to keep yourself hydrated.
            </p>
            <li>Silence your phone</li>
            <p>
              Turn off your phone ringer or activate “do not disturb” mode
              before bed. Notifications can wake you in the middle of the night
              and tempt you to check your phone, which will disrupt your sleep
              cycle. That text message or funny meme will still be there in the
              morning, so do yourself a favor and completely disconnect before
              bed.
            </p>
            <li>Avoid all-nighters</li>
            <p>
              Skipping a night's sleep to finish an assignment is not a wise
              choice. Not only can it lead to exhaustion the next morning, lack
              of sleep can also inhibit your body's ability to function
              properly. According to Vice, a recent study reported that someone
              who goes a night without sleep will often end up with the
              cognitive impairment of an individual who drank to the legal
              limit. This proves just how important sleep is to our bodies. If
              you have a big deadline approaching, avoid procrastinating so you
              won't have to pull an all-nighter to finish your work. You will
              quickly realize the lack of sleep is not worth it.
            </p>
            <li>Sleep with your curtains open</li>
            <p>
              Leave your blinds or curtains slightly open before going to bed.
              This way, sunlight can stream through and help you wake up more
              naturally. On sunny days, this can be an effective strategy.
            </p>
            <li>Place your alarm clock across the room</li>
            <p>
              To avoid snoozing your alarm, place your phone or alarm clock
              across the room from where your bed is. This way, when your alarm
              goes off, you'll be forced to get out of bed to silence it.
              Without the temptation of snoozing your alarm, you'll be up and at
              'em right on time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Training your body to wake up early will take time, so don't
              expect to be able to wake up at 5 a.m. every day just yet. Try
              implementing small changes into your routine to make early wakeups
              feasible, such as setting an earlier bedtime, moving the location
              of your alarm clock or ditching snacks and sugary drinks before
              bed. With these small changes, your body will eventually get in
              the habit of getting up early.
