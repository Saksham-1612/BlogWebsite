          <h2>Write Code in 6 Steps</h2>
          <p>
            There are several different methods and paths you can use when
            learning how to write code. Here are our suggestions for some steps
            to get you started:
          </p>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>Set Goals</li>
            <li>Choose a language</li>
            <li>Find a resource</li>
            <li>Download an Editor</li>
            <li>Start practicing</li>
            <li>Continue learning</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>1.Set Goals</h2>
          <p>
            Before you begin writing code, it is a good idea to take some time
            to consider your goals. Are you hoping to find a new job? Are you
            looking to acquire a valuable skill? Do you want to earn some extra
            money as a freelancer? Your goals will affect your decisions as to
            where and how you learn to code and how much time you will need to
            dedicate to this pursuit.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you want to become a certified expert in coding, you
            will probably need to get a Bachelor's Degree in Programming,
            Software Development or a similar field. However, if your goal in
            pursuing coding is just to learn an interesting new skill, you
            should be able to find all the information you need using free
            resources. The most important part of setting goals is determining
            how much time and energy you will be able to dedicate to coding
          </p>
          <h2>2.Choose a language</h2>
          <p>
            After determining your goals, you will need to choose a coding
            language to learn. The specific language you pick is not as
            important as you may think. Any computer language that you choose to
            study will introduce you to important coding fundamentals like
            structures, commands and programming logic. You might not end up
            using your first language as a part of your job, but you will gain
            valuable experience through the process of mastering it.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are dozens of coding languages that are used for a variety of
            different projects. If you want to code websites, you should learn
            HTML, JavaScript or CSS. If you want to design analysis or
            artificial intelligence programs, you will need to know Python. If
            you are interested in creating personal computer applications, a
            basic language like C++ would be a good choice. You will need to do
            some experimenting and conduct your own research to find a language
            that will work well for you.
          </p>
          <h2>3.Find a resource</h2>
          <p>
            Once you know what you want to learn, it is time to consider your
            resources. There are dozens of quality options available for people
            who want to learn to code. If you are hoping to land your dream job
            in the computer programming industry, you may want to start by
            pursuing a computer science degree on a college campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you prefer to learn in the comfort of your own home, you can
            enroll in an online program through a university or private service.
            If you enjoy teaching yourself, you might find borrowing computer
            programming books from the library, watching how-to videos online or
            using other free resources to be your best option. The effectiveness
            and practicality of each resource will depend on your individual
            learning style and schedule.
          </p>
          <h2>4.Download an Editor</h2>
          <p>
            To write code on your personal computer, you will need a text
            editing program. At their most basic level, most programming
            languages are plain text, which means they can be written using
            almost any simple text editor. Common options include Notepad++,
            TextWrangler and JEdit. Many programming languages have downloadable
            editing programs that are created specifically for that language.
            The best program for you will depend on your budget and which
            language you plan to use most often.
          </p>
          <h2>5.Start practicing</h2>
          <p>
            Once you have picked up some skills by taking classes or watching
            online tutorials, you will need to put your knowledge into practice.
            One of the best ways to learn to code is by simply doing, even if
            you find yourself making mistakes. One of the easiest ways to start
            is by picking a simple project that you think you will be able to
            complete. This could be designing an HTML website, creating a
            database function with PHP or writing a simple program using any of
            the basic languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are hundreds of how-to videos and articles available
            explaining how to complete tasks like these using a variety of
            languages. Using your resources, practice writing code for your
            project until you know the process well enough to complete it on
            your own. Then, you can move on to something even more complex.
            Coding is a skill that comes through repetition and the more you
            practice, the easier it will be.
          </p>
          <h2>6.Continue learning</h2>
          <p>
            As your coding proficiency grows, you will be qualified to advertise
            your services, apply for jobs and even pursue certification. As you
            go about finding ways to use your coding skills, it is important
            that you continue to learn. The computer industry advances and
            evolves each year, with new programs and techniques regularly being
            invented and implemented. To remain competitive and informed, you
            will need to look for ways to continue improving your skills.
            Methods for writing code will advance and develop in the years to
            come, so your skillset will need to evolve at the same rate.
