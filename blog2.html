          <h2>The Four Levels of Reading</h2>
          <p>
            Mortimer Adler literally wrote the book on reading. Adler identifies
            four levels of reading:
          </p>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>Elementary Reading</li>
            <li>Inspectional Reading</li>
            <li>Analytical Reading</li>
            <li>Syntopical Reading</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>1. Elementary Reading</h2>
          <p>
            This is the level of reading taught in our elementary schools. If
            you're reading this website, you already know how to do this
          </p>
          <h2>2. Inspectional Reading</h2>
          <p>
            We've been taught that skimming and superficial reading are bad for
            understanding. That is not necessarily the case. Using these tools
            effectively can increase understanding. Inspectional reading allows
            us to look at the author's blueprint and evaluate the merits of a
            deeper reading experience.
          </p>
          <p>There are two sub-types of inspectional reading:</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Systematic skimming — This is meant to be a quick check of the
              book by (1) reading the preface; (2) studying the table of
              contents; (3) checking the index; and (4) reading the inside
              jacket. This should give you sufficient knowledge to understand
              the chapters in the book, pivotal to the author's argument. Dip in
              here and there, but never with more than a paragraph or two.
              Skimming helps you reach to a decision point: Does this book
              deserve more of my time and attention? If not, you put it down.
            </li>
            <li>
              Superficial reading — This is when you just read. Don't ponder the
              argument, don't look things up, don't write in the margins. If you
              don't understand something, move on. What you gain from this quick
              read will help you later when you go back and put more effort into
              reading. You now come to another decision point. Now that you have
              a better understanding of the book's contents and its structure,
              do you want to understand it?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>3. Analytical Reading</h2>
          <p>
            Francis Bacon once remarked, “some books are to be tasted, others to
            be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.”
          </p>
          <p>
            You can think of analytical reading as doing that chewing and
            digesting. This is doing the work.
          </p>
          <p>Analytical reading is a thorough reading.</p>
          <p>
            If inspectional reading is the best you can do quickly, this is the
            best reading you can do given time.
          </p>
          <h3>There are four rules to Analytical Reading</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.</li>
            <li>State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.</li>
            <li>
              Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline
              these parts as you have outlined the whole.
            </li>
            <li>
              Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You'll probably notice that while those sound pretty easy, they
            involve a lot of work. Luckily the inspectional reading you've
            already done has primed you for this.
          </p>
          <h2>4. Syntopical Reading</h2>
          <p>
            This is also known as comparative reading, and it represents the
            most demanding and difficult reading of all. Syntopical Reading
            involves reading many books on the same subject and comparing and
            contrasting ideas, vocabulary, and arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            This task is undertaken by identifying relevant passages,
            translating the terminology, framing and ordering the questions that
            need answering, defining the issues, and having a conversation with
            the responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is not to achieve an overall understanding of any
            particular book, but rather to understand the subject and develop a
            deep fluency.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is all about identifying and filling in your knowledge gaps.
          </p>
          <h3>There are five steps to syntopical reading:</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Finding the Relevant Passages — You need to find the right books
              and then the passages that are most relevant to filling your
              needs. So the first step is an inspectional reading of all the
              works that you have identified as relevant.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bringing the Author to Terms — In analytical reading, you must
              identify the keywords and how they are used by the author. This is
              fairly straightforward. The process becomes more complicated now
              as each author has probably used different terms and concepts to
              frame their argument. Now the onus is on you to establish the
              terms. Rather than using the author's language, you must use your
              own. In short, this is an exercise in translation and synthesis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Getting the Questions Clear — Rather than focus on the problems
              the author is trying to solve, you need to focus on the questions
              that you want answered. Just as we must establish our own
              terminology, so too must we establish our own propositions by
              shedding light on our problems to which the authors provide
              answers. It's important to frame the questions in such a way that
              all or most of the authors can be interpreted as providing
              answers. Sometimes we might not get an answer to our questions
              because they might not have been seen as questions by the authors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Defining the Issues — If you've asked a clear question to which
              there are multiple answers then an issue has been defined.
              Opposing answers, now translated into your terms, must be ordered
              in relation to one another. Understanding multiple perspectives
              within an issue helps you form an intelligent opinion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Analyzing the Discussion — It's presumptuous to expect we'll find
              a single unchallenged truth to any of our questions. Our answer is
              the conflict of opposing answers. The value is the discussion you
              have with these authors. You can now have an informed opinion.
